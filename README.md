## üß≠ Ethical Discussion (Group Reflection)

AI has tremendous potential to transform healthcare and information systems, but it must be used responsibly.  
Our team emphasized:  
- Protecting **data privacy and patient confidentiality**  
- Preventing **algorithmic bias** that could disadvantage specific groups  
- Maintaining **model transparency** for explainable decision-making  

Each member contributed ethically:  
- Hafsa ensured proper handling and preprocessing of sensitive health data.  
- Brian  The Deep Learning member avoided overfitting that might lead to false predictions.  
- Rodney anonymized textual data to prevent personal exposure.  
- The Ethics lead evaluated fairness and guided responsible AI use.  

Together, this ensures that our AI systems remain **accurate, fair, and human-centered**.
